# About ME

### Meet the Creator
Hi, my name is Richard Shi, and I’m a rising senior at Marriotts Ridge High School. My interest in ADHD stems from a personal place—my younger brother was diagnosed with it when we were both younger, and watching his journey sparked my desire to learn more.

### Why I Decided to Learn About ADHD
After my brother’s diagnosis, I began wondering how I could help him—not just in the moment, but in the long run. I noticed how much of the focus was on medication, and I became curious about whether there were more sustainable, supportive methods for managing ADHD."
